def read_vswir_data(file_path):
    # Read the data from the file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Remove noise from the data
    # Apply a noise reduction technique such as median filtering
    # Example: data = median_filter(data, kernel_size=3)
    
    # Correct for atmospheric effects
    # Apply an atmospheric correction algorithm such as Empirical Line Method (ELM)
    # Example: data = elm_correction(data)
    
    # Convert the data to a numpy array

    return data_array
```

Explanation:

1. Read the data from the file using the `pd.read_csv()` function from the pandas library. This assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file format. If the data is in a different format, the appropriate function should be used (e.g., `pd.read_excel()` for Excel files).

2. Remove noise from the data using a noise reduction technique. In this example, we assume the existence of a `median_filter()` function that applies median filtering to the data. Median filtering is a common technique for removing noise from spectroscopic data.

3. Correct for atmospheric effects using an atmospheric correction algorithm. In this example, we assume the existence of an `elm_correction()` function that applies the Empirical Line Method (ELM) correction to the data. ELM is a widely used method for correcting atmospheric effects in remote sensing data.

4. Convert the processed data to a numpy array using the `to_numpy()` method of the pandas DataFrame. This allows for efficient and convenient manipulation of the data using numpy functions.

Note: The code provided assumes the existence of the necessary functions for noise removal and atmospheric correction. These functions are not implemented in the code snippet, but they should be replaced with the appropriate implementations based on the specific requirements and available libraries for VSWIR imaging spectroscopy data preprocessing.
