import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def read_vswir_data(file_path):
    # Read the data from the file
    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    
    # Remove noise from the data
    # Apply a noise reduction technique such as median filtering
    # Example: data = median_filter(data, kernel_size=3)
    
    # Correct for atmospheric effects
    # Apply an atmospheric correction algorithm such as Empirical Line Method (ELM)
    # Example: data = elm_correction(data)
    
    # Convert the data to a numpy array
    data_array = data.to_numpy()
    
    return data_array
```

Explanation:

1. Read the data from the file using the `pd.read_csv()` function from the pandas library. This assumes that the data is stored in a CSV file format. If the data is in a different format, the appropriate function should be used (e.g., `pd.read_excel()` for Excel files).

2. Remove noise from the data using a noise reduction technique. In this example, we assume the existence of a `median_filter()` function that applies median filtering to the data. Median filtering is a common technique for removing noise from spectroscopic data.

3. Correct for atmospheric effects using an atmospheric correction algorithm. In this example, we assume the existence of an `elm_correction()` function that applies the Empirical Line Method (ELM) correction to the data. ELM is a widely used method for correcting atmospheric effects in remote sensing data.

4. Convert the processed data to a numpy array using the `to_numpy()` method of the pandas DataFrame. This allows for efficient and convenient manipulation of the data using numpy functions.

Note: The code provided assumes the existence of the necessary functions for noise removal and atmospheric correction. These functions are not implemented in the code snippet, but they should be replaced with the appropriate implementations based on the specific requirements and available libraries for VSWIR imaging spectroscopy data preprocessing.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import NMF

def spectral_unmixing(vswir_data, num_endmembers):
    # Normalize the VSWIR data
    vswir_data_normalized = vswir_data / np.max(vswir_data)
    
    # Apply Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to perform spectral unmixing
    model = NMF(n_components=num_endmembers, init='random', random_state=0)
    endmember_abundances = model.fit_transform(vswir_data_normalized)
    endmember_spectra = model.components_
    
    # Calculate the reconstruction error
    reconstruction_error = np.linalg.norm(vswir_data_normalized - np.dot(endmember_abundances, endmember_spectra))
    
    return endmember_spectra, endmember_abundances, reconstruction_error
```

Explanation:
1. The `spectral_unmixing` function takes the VSWIR data as input (`vswir_data`) and the number of endmembers to be estimated (`num_endmembers`).
2. The VSWIR data is first normalized by dividing it by the maximum value to ensure all values are within the range [0, 1].
3. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is applied to the normalized VSWIR data using the `NMF` class from the `sklearn.decomposition` module. NMF is a popular technique for spectral unmixing.
4. The `fit_transform` method of the NMF model is used to estimate the endmember abundances (`endmember_abundances`) and the endmember spectra (`endmember_spectra`).
5. The reconstruction error is calculated as the Frobenius norm of the difference between the normalized VSWIR data and the matrix product of the estimated endmember abundances and endmember spectra.
6. The endmember spectra, endmember abundances, and reconstruction error are returned as the output of the function.
